# ai_village_ctf_30

This repository contains my solutions for the [AI Village Capture the Flag @ DEFCON](https://www.kaggle.com/competitions/ai-village-ctf) Kaggle competition.
I won the competition by being the first competitor to complete 21 out of the 22 problems, since no one solved the 22nd problem.
